# PinePhone64 Install Scripts for use with Termux Android App

Project was started to make it quick and easy to install images on the PinePhone64.  I started my developing endevors using Termux and I still have way more phones than computers.  So here's my attempt at making this script work with Termux.

# Roadmap

 - Add more images
 - Add more tools for formating (bmap-tool, dd)
 - Add a list of drives to verify for user and stress asking if it is the correct drive

# Obstacles

 - I'm going to have a hard time finding the directory of the desired device programically or should I say finding the proper syntax
 - Figureing out how to allow Termux access and write to said device
 - Deciding which package to use to write img file to device
 
# HELP PLEASE

 - This is my first repo so if you have any info, links, advice, or encourgement I'd be very appreciative.
 - There is so much to learn, this is the only way I know to build my skills.  Find a problem and try like hell to fix it.
 - Can anyone tell me where to start?
  

Thanks, Daniel William Foxworth
